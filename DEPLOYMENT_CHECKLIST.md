# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Setup

- [ ] GitHub account ready
- [ ] All files uploaded to GitHub repository
- [ ] Solana keypair generated locally
- [ ] Keypair added to GitHub Secrets as `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`

## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Steps

- [ ] Go to GitHub Actions tab
- [ ] Click "ðŸš€ Deploy Spinza.io Smart Contract"
- [ ] Click "Run workflow" 
- [ ] Select "devnet"
- [ ] Click "Run workflow" again
- [ ] Wait for deployment completion (3-5 minutes)

## ðŸ“‹ Post-Deployment

- [ ] Copy Program ID from deployment logs
- [ ] Update frontend PROGRAM_ID in `utils/solana.js`
- [ ] Test wallet connection
- [ ] Test betting functionality
- [ ] Verify commission payments

## ðŸ”§ Frontend Update Required

After deployment, update this line in your frontend:

```javascript
// In frontend/src/utils/solana.js
const PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('YOUR_NEW_PROGRAM_ID_HERE');
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Commands

```bash
# Test deployment locally
cd scripts
node test-deployment.js

# Check wallet balance
solana balance YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS

# View on explorer
https://explorer.solana.com/address/YOUR_PROGRAM_ID?cluster=devnet
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with "insufficient funds":**
- Keypair needs SOL for deployment fees
- GitHub Actions automatically requests airdrop
- Check airdrop limits (may need multiple runs)

**Frontend can't connect:**
- Verify Program ID is updated
- Check wallet adapter configuration
- Ensure network is set to devnet

**Game initialization fails:**
- Check operator wallet address
- Verify program is deployed correctly
- Run test-deployment.js for diagnosis

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

âœ… GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
âœ… Program ID appears in deployment logs  
âœ… Game state initialization succeeds
âœ… Frontend connects without "Loading..." message
âœ… Wallet connection works
âœ… Test bet can be placed

## ðŸ“ž Support

If stuck:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for error details
2. Verify all secrets are set correctly
3. Test on devnet before mainnet deployment
4. Ensure wallet has sufficient SOL

**Once deployed successfully, your Spinza.io game is live on Solana! ðŸŽ®ðŸš€**
